"""Test SWAG Nginx Routing Configuration
Following CLAUDE.md - NO MOCKING, real services only!

This test suite verifies that SWAG nginx routing is correctly configured
for all services, including path-based routing via explicit location blocks.

SWAG uses static nginx proxy-conf files (*.subdomain.conf) instead of
Traefik docker labels.  Authentication is enforced via
`auth_request /_oauth_verify` in location blocks that require a valid token.
OAuth endpoints (/register, /authorize, /token, etc.) do NOT have auth_request
so they remain freely accessible as required by RFC 7591.
